# Running

- Compile and Run

    ```
    mvn clean package spring-boot:run    
    ```

# Test your application

Generated application comes with sample test process that allows you to verify if the application is working as expected. Simply execute following command to try it out

```sh
curl -d '{}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8080/greetings
                                                             
```

Once successfully invoked you should see "Hello World" in the console of the running application.

The generated application provides out of the box multiple samples of Kogito assets; you can reference the generated Swagger documentation and JUnit tests.

# Developing
